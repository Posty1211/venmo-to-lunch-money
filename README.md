# Venmo to Lunch Money

An Express.js based app that transforms Venmo emails into [Lunch Money](lunch-money) transactions.

:warning: **This script is not yet publish-quality yet.**

This just the result of one evening hack session. Several tasks remain before
it is ready for prime time. I've made this available in case it's useful to
anyone else looking to include Venmo transactions in Lunch Money.
**Use at your own risk.**
